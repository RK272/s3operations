git lab connection with vs code

Step 1: Ensure the SSH Agent is Running
Start the SSH agent (if itâ€™s not already running):
bash
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
This command will start the SSH agent and display its process ID.
Step 2: Add Your Private Key
Add your private key to the SSH agent:
bash
Copy code
ssh-add D:/django/app_points/dd
Replace D:/django/app_points/dd with the correct path to your private key file if it's located somewhere else.
Step 3: Verify the Key is Added
After adding the key, verify again by running:
bash
Copy code
ssh-add -l
This time, you should see your SSH key listed.
Step 4: Test the SSH Connection Again
Finally, test the SSH connection to GitLab again:
bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@gitlab.com
You should see a welcome message confirming that your SSH key is correctly set up.
